Future features possibilities:

0) Move deck shuffling class into a test_??? class and take it out of
   Card. Re-factor code so that start_server and tests use the same
   deck stacking code. [DONE]

1) Currently, the game allows the player to lie about what is in his
   hand.  It might be an interesting feature to allow this, but allow
   other players to accuse him/her of lying, with an appropriate
   penalty, losing all books or losing the game, if rightly accused or
   the accuser getting the penalty if incorrect.

2) Alternately, prevent the player from asking for cards he does not
   possess.

3) Save a list of all moves made; potentially deck & game status as
   well (for roll-back or re-play)

4) If the deck is shuffled, it does not formally have to be dealt.
   The program can just take the first 'N' cards.  Then stacking the
   deck would be straightforward: feed the cards in groups of
   <hand-size>.  Re-factoring to do this would eliminate
   testhelpers.rb and make it easier to spin stacked-deck scenarios
   for testing.
